# CSVEditorPHP 2022
2022 CSV Online Editor (PHP &amp; JavaScript)

＜You can **create/edit/delete/download CSV** on the web!＞

This is a hardfork from [CSVEditor](https://github.com/Kortforsyningen/CSVEditor).
I improved various parts from the original CSVEditor. 

(Mobile support, CSV creation & deletion supports, the latest library supports, CSV download support, special CSV supports, and so on)

# WARNING

・You always need the title columns for the 1st line in your CSV.

・Please set the appropriate folder permissions such as 705, 777, 707 or whatever depends on your server setting. Otherwise, saving CSV might fail.

# Localisation is verrrrrry easy! WOW!!

I prepared all used texts in one place! All you need is just modify texts in config.php.
Currently all texts are written in Japanese, but I also prepared the English versions too in each comment, so please replace them if you prefer English or whatever other languages.

# Installation

Just download the file and put everything on your server that supports PHP! 
(change the folder permissions if needed.)

After that, you can open the directory on your browser! Very easy, right?
