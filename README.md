# CSVEditorPHP
2022 CSV Online Editor (PHP &amp; JavaScript)

This is a hardfork from [CSVEditor](https://github.com/Kortforsyningen/CSVEditor).
I improved various parts from the original CSVEditor. 
(Responsive, the latest jquery supports, CSV download support, special CSV support, and so on)

# WARNING

You always need the title columns for the 1st line in your CSV.
